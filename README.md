An algorithm that will organize a group's housing, taking into account 
different group sizes, housing capacities and number of units with that 
housing capacity.  

Example:  
Group of 10, 7, 8, 9  
Housing types: 2  
Number of housing type 1: 2  
Housing type 1 capacity: 8   

Number of housing type 2: 2  
Housing type 2 capacity: 10    

Has a feasible solution, group of 7 and 8 in housing type 1,  
group of 9 and 10 in housing type 2.
